    "Predicting Korfball Results with Statistical Modelling: Dixon-Coles and Time-Weighting\n",
    "====\n",
    "*This post describes two popular improvements to the standard Poisson model for football predictions applied to korfball, collectively known as the Dixon-Coles model*\n",
    "\n",
    "In an earlier post, I showed how to build a simple Poisson model to crudely predict the outcome of korfball matches. In the same way teams herald slight changes to their traditional plain coloured jerseys as ground breaking, I thought I'd show how the basic model could be tweaked and improved in order to achieve revolutionary status.\n",
    "\n",
    "The changes are motivated by a combination of intuition and statistics. The [Dixon-Coles](http://web.math.ku.dk/~rolf/teaching/thesis/DixonColes.pdf) model (named after the paper's authors) corrects for the basic model's underestimation of draws and it also incorporated a time component so that recent matches are considered more important in calculating average goals rate. This isn't a particularly nodel idea for a blog post. There are numerous implementations of the Dixon-Coles model out there. Like any niche statistical modelling exercise, however, they are mostly available in R. I strongly recommend the excellent [opisthokonta blog](http://opisthokonta.net/?cat=48), especially if you're interested in more advanced models. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll initially pull the match results for the EKL 2018/2019 season from [fixtureslive.com](https://w.fixtureslive.com/comp/57863/table/England-Korfball-National-League-EKL-Premier-Division-2018-19). This code is pretty much the same as last time."
